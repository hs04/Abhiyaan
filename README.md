Previous Experience:
I know OpenCV, made some small projects like motion detector,color detector etc.
Created a sudoko solver
Knows basic competetive coding stuffs.
I have experience with python and C++. I also know openCV(computer vision). I know basics of Robot Operating system.
Using python I have done a lot of competetive coding. I have also done many small projects like motion detector,color detector,image editing apps with python using openCV.
I have made several small graphical games like astro wars,car racing,tetris,etc with python(pyGame).
Using C++, I made sudoko solver,splitwise application, various data(numerical) analysis codes like interopolation ,differential equation solver,integration,differentiation,etc.
I am learning ML(Andrew Ng Coursera).
I am comfortable with python,C++,openCV (just need to google syntax sometimes.)
I am slightly familiar with ROS and ML.

Current PORs:
None

Why I want to be in this team?
I am fascinated by the idea of self-driving cars. Many tasks could be made autonomous.Future will become exhilarating!
Also I love coding.
